      "4. **Join the Two Files**:\n",
      "   - The code attempts to find the college name in 'data_ext.csv' by filtering with the identified names.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Handling Missing Data**:\n",
      "   - It safely checks if the persons with the identified salary exist in the second file and assigns \"Unknown\" if college names are missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the description of the user query, the result appears correct— the code correctly follows the logic to produce the desired outputs: identifying both the person associated with max/min salaries and their respective college names.\n",
